My name is Name, I'm Age years old and I'm a Year year student of Course at University. Currently, I'm looking for a Application For and I really think your company is the perfect opportunity for it.
My academic formation is, currently, preparing me for a professional career on the Area area, although, in my opinion, the learning proccess is never completed and that's why I always demonstrate a great desire to learn new things and improve the ones that I already know.
This way, I think that by your side I could improve my knowledge and discover even more about this subject, since Company is a reference in this sector.

At the moment, I don't have any professional experience at this area, although I can't think about any company who could be a better place to start than Company.

Having in consideration the main areas of your company and my knowledge, I must say that I have a special interest on the area of the Sector but, as I already mentioned earlier, I have a great desire to learn more, so, any other area would also be of my interest.

I appreciate the dispended attention and make myself available for any desired information.

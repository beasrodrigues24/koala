My name is Arlindo Barnabé, I'm 20 years old and I'm a 3rd year student of Software Engineering at Universidade do Minho. Currently, I'm looking for a Summer Internship and I really think your company is the perfect opportunity for it.
My academic formation is, currently, preparing me for a professional career on the Software Engineering area, although, in my opinion, the learning proccess is never completed and that's why I always demonstrate a great desire to learn new things and improve the ones that I already know.
This way, I think that by your side I could improve my knowledge and discover even more about this subject, since Sports Interactive is a reference in this sector.

At the moment, I don't have any professional experience at this area, although I can't think about any company who could be a better place to start than Sports Interactive.

Having in consideration the main areas of your company and my knowledge, I must say that I have a special interest on the area of the Games Programming but, as I already mentioned earlier, I have a great desire to learn more, so, any other area would also be of my interest.

I appreciate the dispended attention and make myself available for any desired information.
